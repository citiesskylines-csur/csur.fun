				<p>Thank you for visiting CSUR. We respect and protect the privacy of our users. This privacy policy tells you how
					we collect and use information.</p>
				<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
				<p>We collect information from you when you register on our site and gather data when you participate in the forum
					by reading, writing and evaluating the content shared here.</p>
				<p>When registering on our site, you may be asked to enter your name and email address. You may, however, visit our
					site without registering. Your email address will be verified by an email containing a unique link. If that link
					is visited, we know that you control the email address.</p>
				<p>When registered and posting, we record the IP address that the post originated from. We also may retain server
					logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.</p>
				<h2>What do we use your information for?</h2>
				<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To personalise your experience - your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs.</li>
					<li>To improve our site - we continually strive to improve our site offerings based on the information and
						feedback we receive from you.</li>
					<li>To improve customer service - your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service
						requests and support needs.</li>
					<li>To send periodic emails - the email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications
						that you request about changes to topics or in response to your username, respond to inquiries and/or other
						requests or questions.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
				<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter,
					submit or access your personal information.</p>
				<h2>What is your data retention policy?</h2>
				<p>We will make a good faith effort to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server for no more than 90 days.</li>
					<li>Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users and their posts for no more than 5 years.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Do we use cookies?</h2>
				<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through
					your browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognise your browser and, if you have a registered
					account, associate it with your registered account. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate
					settings on your browser, however, if you do this you may not be able to use all functionality on our site.</p>
				<p>We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site
					traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract
					with third party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers
					are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our
					business.</p>
				<h2>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>
				<p>We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This
					does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business or servicing
					you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information
					when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies or protect ours or others
					rights, property or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other
					parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.</p>
				<p>Our website uses Google, CNZZ, and Busuanzi Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google, CNZZ, and Busuanzi servers in the
					United States or China. Google, CNZZ, and Busuanzi Analytics does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with any other
					data held by Google, CNZZ, and Busuanzi. We use reports provided by Google, CNZZ, and Busuanzi Analytics to help us understand website traffic and webpage
					usage.</p>
				<p>By using CSUR, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google, CNZZ, and Busuanzi in the manner described in Google's, CNZZ's, and Busuanzi's
					Privacy Policy and for the purposes set out above. You can opt out of Google, CNZZ, and Busuanzi Analytics if you disable or refuse
					the cookie, disable JavaScript, or use the opt-out service provided by Google, CNZZ, and Busuanzi. Be aware that if you disable
					JavaScript completely you will impact the normal functionality of CSUR.</p>
				<h2>Third Party Links</h2>
				<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our site. These
					third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability
					for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site
					and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
