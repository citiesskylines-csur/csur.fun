The inability for the game to distinguish between left and right forks makes it unable to create road markings at ramps. For instance, one lane forked out of a 4-lane highway can be either a left exit or a right exit, yet the game cannot tell one from the other. Another example is where a lane begins or ends on a road. When a 3-lane road becomes a 4-lane road in the real world, a lane is usually added to the left or right of the road, which makes the 3-lane and the 4-lane aligned to the right or to the left, respectively. However in the vanilla game, directly connecting a 3-lane road to a 4-lane road will make them aligned to the center. As a result, one has to carefully adjust the position of the roads using Move It and manually place lane markings so as to build realistically in the vanilla road system.
